## Notebook principles

A notebook does not have to have all of your code, or every experiment you did with it. Instead, it's meant to represent lessons learned and to carry forward in the future. 

A good notebook entry typicall addresses four things:

- Context: What problem does your work solve?
- Action: What did you choose to do? (Often contains excerpt of your code or parameters.)
- Explanation: How does it work? (Often but not always domain-specific.)
- Expectation: What does the outcome look like?
